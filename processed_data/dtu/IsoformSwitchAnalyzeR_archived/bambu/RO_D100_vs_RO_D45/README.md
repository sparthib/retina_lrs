`DEXSeqSwitchList` info on all genes that have DTU events 

`switches` genes that have significant DTU events `abs(DTU) > 1` and  `FDR < 0.05`

`switch vs degs` genes with `abs(logFC) > 2` and significant DTU events `abs(DTU) > 1` and  `FDR < 0.05`

`isoform abundance` Transcripts per million

`isoform counts` raw counts 

`top_genes` same as  `switches`

`non DTUs` isoforms that were expressed in only one of the conditions

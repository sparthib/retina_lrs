Detected 2 warnings across the samples during read class construction. Access warnings with metadata(bambuOutput)$warnings
--- Start extending annotations ---
For your combination of sample and reference annotations we recommend an NDR of 0.044. You are currently using an NDR threshold of 1. A higher NDR is suited for samples where the reference annotations are poor and more novel transcripts are expected,whereas a lower NDR is suited for samples with already high quality annotations
Warning messages:
1: There was 1 warning in `summarise()`.
ℹ In argument: `intersectWidth = max(intersectWidth)`.
Caused by warning in `max()`:
! no non-missing arguments to max; returning -Inf 
2: Returning more (or less) than 1 row per `summarise()` group was deprecated in
dplyr 1.1.0.
ℹ Please use `reframe()` instead.
ℹ When switching from `summarise()` to `reframe()`, remember that `reframe()`
  always returns an ungrouped data frame and adjust accordingly.
ℹ The deprecated feature was likely used in the bambu package.
  Please report the issue to the authors. 
3: There was 1 warning in `summarise()`.
ℹ In argument: `intersectWidth = max(intersectWidth)`.

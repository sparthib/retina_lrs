_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

package, help: the name of a package, given as a name or literal
          character string, or a character string, depending on whether
          'character.only' is 'FALSE' (default) or 'TRUE'.

     pos: the position on the search list at which to attach the loaded
          namespace.  Can also be the name of a position on the current
          search list as given by 'search()'.

 lib.loc: a character vector describing the location of R library trees
          to search through, or 'NULL'.  The default value of 'NULL'
          corresponds to all libraries currently known to
          '.libPaths()'.  Non-existent library trees are silently
          ignored.

character.only: a logical indicating whether 'package' or 'help' can be
          assumed to be character strings.

logical.return: logical.  If it is 'TRUE', 'FALSE' or 'TRUE' is
          returned to indicate success.

warn.conflicts: logical.  If 'TRUE', warnings are printed about
          'conflicts' from attaching the new package.  A conflict is a
          function masking a function, or a non-function masking a
          non-function. The default is 'TRUE' unless specified as
          'FALSE' in the 'conflicts.policy' option.

 verbose: a logical.  If 'TRUE', additional diagnostics are printed.

 quietly: a logical.  If 'TRUE', no message confirming package
          attaching is printed, and most often, no errors/warnings are
          printed if package attaching fails.

     pkg: character string naming a package.

 mask.ok: character vector of names of objects that can mask objects on
          the search path without signaling an error when strict
          conflict checking is enabled

exclude,include.only: character vector of names of objects to exclude
          or include in the attached frame. Only one of these arguments
          may be used in a call to 'library' or 'require'.

attach.required: logical specifying whether required packages listed in
          the 'Depends' clause of the 'DESCRIPTION' file should be
          attached automatically.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     'library(package)' and 'require(package)' both load the namespace
     of the package with name 'package' and attach it on the search
     list.  'require' is designed for use inside other functions; it
     returns 'FALSE' and gives a warning (rather than an error as
     'library()' does by default) if the package does not exist.  Both
     functions check and update the list of currently attached packages
     and do not reload a namespace which is already loaded.  (If you
     want to reload such a package, call 'detach(unload = TRUE)' or
     'unloadNamespace' first.)  If you want to load a package without
     attaching it on the search list, see 'requireNamespace'.

     To suppress messages during the loading of packages use
     'suppressPackageStartupMessages': this will suppress all messages
     from R itself but not necessarily all those from package authors.

     If 'library' is called with no 'package' or 'help' argument, it
     lists all available packages in the libraries specified by
     'lib.loc', and returns the corresponding information in an object
     of class '"libraryIQR"'.  (The structure of this class may change
     in future versions.)  Use '.packages(all = TRUE)' to obtain just
     the names of all available packages, and 'installed.packages()'
     for even more information.

     'library(help = somename)' computes basic information about the
     package 'somename', and returns this in an object of class
     '"packageInfo"'.  (The structure of this class may change in
     future versions.)  When used with the default value ('NULL') for
     'lib.loc', the attached packages are searched before the
     libraries.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     Normally 'library' returns (invisibly) the list of attached
     packages, but 'TRUE' or 'FALSE' if 'logical.return' is 'TRUE'.
     When called as 'library()' it returns an object of class
     '"libraryIQR"', and for 'library(help=)', one of class
     '"packageInfo"'.

     'require' returns (invisibly) a logical indicating whether the
     required package is available.

_C_o_n_f_l_i_c_t_s:

     Handling of conflicts depends on the setting of the
     'conflicts.policy' option. If this option is not set, then
     conflicts result in warning messages if the argument
     'warn.conflicts' is 'TRUE'. If the option is set to the character
     string '"strict"', then all unresolved conflicts signal errors.
     Conflicts can be resolved using the 'mask.ok', 'exclude', and
     'include.only' arguments to 'library' and 'require'. Defaults for
     'mask.ok' and 'exclude' can be specified using 'conflictRules'.

     If the 'conflicts.policy' option is set to the string
     '"depends.ok"' then conflicts resulting from attaching declared
     dependencies will not produce errors, but other conflicts will.
     This is likely to be the best setting for most users wanting some
     additional protection against unexpected conflicts.

     The policy can be tuned further by specifying the
     'conflicts.policy' option as a named list with the following
     fields:

     'error': logical; if 'TRUE' treat unresolved conflicts as errors.

     'warn': logical; unless 'FALSE' issue a warning message when
          conflicts are found.

     'generics.ok': logical; if 'TRUE' ignore conflicts created by
          defining S4 generics for functions on the search path.

     'depends.ok': logical; if 'TRUE' do not treat conflicts with
          required packages as errors.

     'can.mask': character vector of names of packages that are allowed
          to be masked. These would typically be base packages attached
          by default.

_L_i_c_e_n_s_e_s:

     Some packages have restrictive licenses, and there is a mechanism
     to allow users to be aware of such licenses.  If
     'getOption("checkPackageLicense") == TRUE', then at first use of a
     namespace of a package with a not-known-to-be-FOSS (see below)
     license the user is asked to view and accept the license: a list
     of accepted licenses is stored in file '~/.R/licensed'.  In a
     non-interactive session it is an error to use such a package whose
     license has not already been recorded as accepted.

     Free or Open Source Software (FOSS, e.g.
     <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOSS>) packages are determined by
     the same filters used by 'available.packages' but applied to just
     the current package, not its dependencies.

     There can also be a site-wide file 'R_HOME/etc/licensed.site' of
     packages (one per line).

_F_o_r_m_a_l _m_e_t_h_o_d_s:

     'library' takes some further actions when package 'methods' is
     attached (as it is by default).  Packages may define formal
     generic functions as well as re-defining functions in other
     packages (notably 'base') to be generic, and this information is
     cached whenever such a namespace is loaded after 'methods' and
     re-defined functions (implicit generics) are excluded from the
     list of conflicts.  The caching and check for conflicts require
     looking for a pattern of objects; the search may be avoided by
     defining an object '.noGenerics' (with any value) in the
     namespace.  Naturally, if the package _does_ have any such
     methods, this will prevent them from being used.

_N_o_t_e:

     'library' and 'require' can only load/attach an _installed_
     package, and this is detected by having a 'DESCRIPTION' file
     containing a 'Built:' field.

     Under Unix-alikes, the code checks that the package was installed
     under a similar operating system as given by 'R.version$platform'
     (the canonical name of the platform under which R was compiled),
     provided it contains compiled code.  Packages which do not contain
     compiled code can be shared between Unix-alikes, but not to other
     OSes because of potential problems with line endings and
     OS-specific help files.  If sub-architectures are used, the OS
     similarity is not checked since the OS used to build may differ
     (e.g. 'i386-pc-linux-gnu' code can be built on an
     'x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu' OS).

     The package name given to 'library' and 'require' must match the
     name given in the package's 'DESCRIPTION' file exactly, even on
     case-insensitive file systems such as are common on Windows and
     macOS.
